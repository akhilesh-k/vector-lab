    <h3>Release Notes</h3>
    <section class="release-note">
      <h4>Version 1.3.0</h4>
      <h5>10th November 2023</h5>
      <p>Now which search terms are audited by auditors can be found</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Audit Report: We can see the auditor's search terms by filtering by
          Auditor's name.
        </li>
        <li>
          Date Range filter: We have given a date range filter on the Audit
          report page to filter the results based on the date range selected.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bug Fixes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Audit mode checkbox while navigating from Sidebar: In case of
          navigating to the perform Audit page from the vector search page,
          audit mode checkbox was not selected by default. This issue has been
          fixed in the 10th November deployment.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Version 1.2.0</h4>
      <h5>9th November 2023</h5>
      <p>We are excited to introduce the following features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Audit Report: Now we can see the Auditors and the Audit history they
          have done. This can be accessed by
          <span. class="url" @click="pushToRoute('/audit-history')"
            >clicking here</span.
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Top Audited Search terms: Now we can see the top audited search terms
          for lexical and hybrid search types. We can also see the top search
          terms where the search results or Relevant or Irrelevant
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Version 1.1.0</h4>
      <h5>8th November 2023</h5>
      <p>
        There has been a couple of improvements in the Overall UI. Below are the
        gist of the changes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Navigation Sidebar: Have added sidebar for navigation and can be
          accessed by clicking the left top button.
        </li>
        <li>
          Separated Vector Search and Audit Space: Now for the ease of the
          auditing processes, we are segregating the Vector search and the
          Auditing page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduced configuration elements for Audit mode: Perform audit has fewer
          options to configure, namely Algo, debug (just in case we want to
          check the scores).
        </li>
        <li>
          Relevant and Irrelevant result counts: In the backend, we are now
          saving the count of relevant and irrelevant products so that we can
          further create any sort of visualizations from the audit data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bug Fixes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          No result page leading to white screen: In case of no result pages,
          vector lab would run into an issue where only blank page was shown. We
          have now fixed it and it has very descriptive details.
        </li>
      </ul>

          download the excel file and save the audit data with many details,
          like audit date, algo, search term, NDCG score, auditor, audited
          products
