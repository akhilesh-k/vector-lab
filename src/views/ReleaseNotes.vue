      <h4>Version 1.1.0</h4>
      <h5>8th November 2023</h5>
      <p>
        There has been a couple of improvements in the Overall UI. Below are the
        gist of the changes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Navigation Sidebar: Have added sidebar for navigation and can be
          accessed by clicking the left top button.
        </li>
        <li>
          Separated Vector Search and Audit Space: Now for the ease of the
          auditing processes, we are segregating the Vector search and the
          Auditing page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduced configuration elements for Audit mode: Perform audit has fewer
          options to configure, namely Algo, debug (just in case we want to
          check the scores).
        </li>
        <li>
          Relevant and Irrelevant result counts: In the backend, we are now
          saving the count of relevant and irrelevant products so that we can
          further create any sort of visualizations from the audit data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bug Fixes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          No result page leading to white screen: In case of no result pages,
          vector lab would run into an issue where only blank page was shown. We
          have now fixed it and it has very descriptive details.
        </li>
      </ul>

          Download Audit details in excel sheet: Clicking on submit audit will
          download the excel file and save the audit data with many details,
          like audit date, algo, search term, NDCG score, auditor, audited
          products
